Below is the output for Assignment 6:

The average number of comparisons needed to answer a query is:
(15 + 29 + 16 + 21 + 24 + 33 + 30 + 21 + 22 + 16 + 14 + 17 + 14 + 32 + 33)/15 = 22.47

The average number of comparisons needed to answer a successful query is:
(15 + 29 + 16 + 21 + 24 + 30 + 21 + 14 + 17 + 14)/10 = 20.1

The average number of comparisons needed to answer an unsuccessful query is:
(33 + 22 + 16 + 32 + 33)/5 = 27.2

Below is the output for Assignment 4:

The average number of comparisons needed to answer a query is:
(38383 + 7761 + 611 + 8071 + 41914 + 43364 + 43090 + 4758 + 43364 + 32308 + 6790 + 9648 + 41341 + 43364 + 43364)/15 = 27196.73333333

The average number of comparisons needed to answer a successful query is:
(38383 + 7761 + 611 + 8071 + 41914 + 43090 + 4758 + 32308 + 6790 + 9648 + 41341)/11 = 21317.72727272

The average number of comparisons needed to answer an unsuccessful query is:
4 * 43364/4 = 43364

After comparing the number of comparisons in Assignment 4 to the one in Assignment 6, we can conclude that the Binary Tree is significantly faster than the linear search.
